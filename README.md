# Quantum-SVM
Quantum Support Vector Machine for  Data Classification


This jupyter notebook gives a brief repetition of classical Support Vector Machines (SVM) and an introduction into quantum feature maps, quantum kernels and QSVM. The QSVM is implemented with QISKIT.

In this work, the MNIST handwritten data set was used. From Mnist dataset, I have used only two digits and a very small
amount of data points to fit in the available near term quantum devices.

While the accuracy of the quantum SVM algorithm is nearly 100%, the accuracy of the classical-SVM algorithm is 97%.
